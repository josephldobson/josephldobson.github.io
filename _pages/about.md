Hey! I'm a Data Science and Machine Learning MSc student at UCL. I'm currently interested in both theoretical and applied machine learning, especially 3D scene reconstruction and computer vision, my masters thesis will be on 3D gaussian splatting for dynamic scenes with Gabriel Brostow. Previously I was a mathematics student at Durham University, where I also exchanged at ETH Zurich for a year. I also worked as an image analysis research intern at Canon, where I worked on tracking vessel trees in interventional video streams.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
